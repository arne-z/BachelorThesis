# BachelorThesis

This Project is part of my Bachelor Thesis.  
The aim is to create a DSL to configure [Dialogflow](https://dialogflow.com/) agents via a small configuration file, that is easily human readable and source-control firendly.  
Among benefits provided by this approach are: 
- Quick creation of Dialogflow agents via script file with IDE support
- Small Diffs in source control  

This is developed alongside [Ask your Repository](https://github.com/hpi-sam/ask-your-repository-dialogflow-adapter) where we are planning to use this DSL for the configuration of our agent.
