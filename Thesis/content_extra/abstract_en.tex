\chapter*{Abstract (English)}

This thesis seeks to address a current lack of version control systems for voice interface configurations. Instead of designing a new version control system for voice interface configurations, here a different solution is chosen. The voice interface configuration is adapted to fit into exising version control systems.
This is done by designing a domain specific language to describe the configuration of a voice interface in a text based way.
The voice interface technology chosen to demonstrate this solution is Google Dialogflow. The version control system chosen to focus on is Git, using Github.
For evaluation an experiment with 5 test cases was conducted comparing the domain specific language with the existing technology.
The results show a clear benefit in three of four cirteria outlined while maintaining parity in the fourth.
