@article{Voelter2013,
abstract = {This book covers DSL Design, Implementation and Use of DSL in detail. It consists of four parts. Part 1 introduces DSLs in general and discusses their advantages and drawbacks. It also defines important terms and concepts and introduces the case studies used in the most of the re-mainder of the book. Part 2 discusses the design of DSLs – independent of implementation techniques. It discusses seven design dimensions, explains a number of reusable language paradigms and points out a number of process-related issues. Part 3 provides details about the implementation of DSLs with lots of code. It uses three state-of-the-art but quite different language workbenches: Jet-Brains MPS, Eclipse Xtext and TU Delft's Spoofax. Part 4 discusses the use of DSLs for requirements, architecture, implementation and product line engineering, as well as their roles as a developer utility and for implementing business logic.},
